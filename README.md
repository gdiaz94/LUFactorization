# LU Factorization
## Purpose
The LUFactorization.java program takes in a square matrix and performs LU factorization
with partial pivoting on it (A = P'LU). It prints out P', L, and U to the console once
it is finished.

## Input File Format
The program gets the matrix from an input file (input.txt) in this order: first line
contains an integer representing the number of rows/colunms in the sqare matrix, each
line after that represents the elements of the matrix (can be integers or decimals).

Example:
4
3 7 0 5
6 1 1 1
0 2 6 4
1 8 2 1
